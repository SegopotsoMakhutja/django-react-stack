# Databases

You'll see two directories here:

## localhost

You will need this if:

- you are running the development server
- you aer running unit tests on your local computer

## cloudsql

You will need this if:

- you are running database migrations for a cloud hosted application
- you need to examine the state of a cloud database

### NOTE

If you make use of the cloud sql tooling while running the development server or unit tests then you are doing it wrong.
